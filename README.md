# PitchPerfect & My First Version Control
Truly my first repository ever!

This is the repo for my [Version Control With Git] at Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123). The app, PitchPerfect, is from another course at Udacity, called [iOS App Development Nanodegree] (https://www.udacity.com/course/ios-developer-nanodegree--nd003), and it's about recording the user's voice and changing its pitch to 6 different tones.

This repo contains the source code used to create the app during the course.
